          <p>Thank you for your interest in our research.  </p>
          <p>We are working with the <strong id="audit-name">[name of national audit]</strong> to investigate ways of making feedback from reports more useful to clinicians and managers.</p>
            <p>This initially involves asking volunteers, such as yourself, to look through different ways of presenting feedback.  Whilst the feedback we show you is hypothetical, it is based upon recent and real audit data.  We will then ask you some questions to assess your reactions to the feedback.  After you have submitted your responses, we will give you the option of reading a brief summary of evidence on how to make feedback more effective in case it is useful in your own work.  We will finally ask for your name and contact information but only if you wish to receive the Â£25 voucher and certificate of completion for your continuing professional development records.</p>
            <p>Estimated completion time is *30 minutes*</p>
