            <p>Improving the impact of national clinical audits</p>
            <h3>What is the purpose of the study?</h3>
            <p>
            National clinical audits play a key role in monitoring and improving the quality of patient care. Feedback from these audits can help to identify and address areas for improvement. There is evidence that the way that feedback is presented can influence how professionals and organisations respond, e.g. through use of different comparators, or by including different messages to accompany the feedback. There are many possible ways to present feedback but we are uncertain how different methods affect how recipients act on it.
            We are audit and feedback researchers working in partnership with people responsible for designing and delivering national audits. We plan to test ways to improve the impact of national audits. This interview-based study will explore how possible feedback modifications could be delivered, to help us decide which recommendations are suitable for future development to improve feedback effectiveness.
            </p>
            </h3>Why have I been invited?</h3>
            <p>  
            We wish to interview a range of individuals with involvement in or experience of audit and feedback. We are interested in exploring participants’ use of and views about proposed approaches for presenting feedback.
            </p>
            <h3>    
            Do I have to take part?</h3>
            <p>
            It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to participate, you will be required to sign a consent form. You may still withdraw at any time, without giving a reason, without it affecting you (including any relationship you have with national audit programmes). If you withdraw more than 48h after your interview, it will no longer be possible to withdraw your data as analysis will have begun. Please note that we may not approach all of those expressing an interest in participating: we have limited interview spaces and wish to include people from a variety of backgrounds and experience. If you are not approached, we will not retain your contact details.
            </p>
            <h3>What will happen if I take part and what will I have to do?</h3>
            <p>
            A member of the research team will contact you to discuss the study further and arrange a face- to-face interview. The interview will take place at a location convenient to you, e.g. your place of work or the University. You will be presented with one or more modified versions of audit data (on paper or on a computer screen) and asked to complete a ‘think aloud’ interview, i.e. you will be asked to describe your thoughts and feelings as you consider the data presented. For example, you may be asked how simple you find it to understand what is being presented, or what you feel the key messages to be. We expect interviews to last around 30 to 60 minutes. With your prior agreement, the interview will be audio- and video-recorded. Anything you do on the computer will be recorded using screen capture software. We may also ask your permission to record where you are looking using an eye tracker.
            </p>
            <h3>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</h3>
            <p>    
            We anticipate no direct risks of participation, other than time and inconvenience.
            </p>
            <h3>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h3>
            <p>We hope that you would find the experience interesting and it is hoped that the study will provide us with modifications that can be developed to improve the effectiveness of feedback, with subsequent benefits for patient health.
            In recognition of your time and any inconvenience of taking part in this research, you will be offered a <strong>£25 voucher and a certificate of completion</strong> for your continuing professional development records.</p>
            <h3>Will the information I provide be treated confidentially?</h3>
            <p>Yes, all information provided will be confidential and held securely at the University of Leeds and City, University of London. Any information that could identify individuals will be removed from the interview transcript. Direct quotes may be included in reports arising from this work, but they will be anonymised and no individual will be identifiable. The data collected may be used in relevant future research in an anonymised form. Other genuine researchers will have access to this data only if they agree to preserve confidentiality.</p>
            <h3>What will happen to the results of this study?</h3>
            <p>This work is being completed ahead of a wider evaluation of feedback modifications. These interviews will help us to decide which modifications can be tested in an online experiment. The online experiment will take place later this year; people taking part in the current design process will not be approached to participate in that experiment.
            As well as writing up our research findings for journal and conference publication, we will share key findings with national audit programmes in the UK and internationally.</p>
            <h3>Who is organising this study?</h3>
            <p>Our team comprises experienced researchers from the UK (University of Leeds, City, University of London, and University of Manchester) and Canada as well as collaborators from national audit programmes. The chief investigator is Robbie Foy, a general practitioner and Professor of Primary Care at the University of Leeds.</p>
            <h3>Who is funding this study?</h3>
            <p>This study has been funded by the Health Services and Delivery Research Programme of the National Institute for Health Research (Project Number 16/04/13).</p>
            <h3>Who has reviewed the study?</h3>
            <p>This study has been reviewed and given a favourable opinion by the School of Medicine Research Ethics Committee at the University of Leeds (MREC16-180).</p>
            <h3>What if I need further information?</h3>
            <p>Please contact Dr Tom Willis, our senior research fellow (T.A.Willis@leeds.ac.uk; 0113 343 7119). Alternatively, if you have any concerns about this research, please contact Professor Suzanne Richards (s.h.richards@leeds.ac.uk; 0113 343 9815) who is independent of the research team.</p>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this information sheet.</p>
